# Database Integration

## Why We Used UserDefaults

We implemented **UserDefaults** for storing favorite movies due to its simplicity and efficiency for small data storage. UserDefaults is well-suited for:
- **Lightweight Data Storage:** Ideal for saving user preferences like movie IDs and titles.  
- **Persistence:** Ensures user favorites are saved even after the app is closed and reopened.  
- **Ease of Implementation:** Quick to set up without complex configurations.  

For more complex data handling in future updates, integrating Core Data or Realm could be explored.

## How We Used UserDefaults

| Feature                | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Save to Favorites**  | Users can add movies to their Favorites list.                |
| **Remove from Favorites** | Users can remove movies from their Favorites list.        |
| **Persistent Storage** | Favorites are saved locally and persist between app launches.|
